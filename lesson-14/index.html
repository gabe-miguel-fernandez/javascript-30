    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // NOTE: players references team array
    const team = players;
    console.log("players = " + players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log("players = " + players);
    console.log("team = " + team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // NOTE: slice with no argument returns copy of original array
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    team5[0] = "cool";
    console.log("players = " + players);
    console.log("team5 = " + team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy but it's actually a reference

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // starts with blank object, pass in object to copy from, add any property to overwrite
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 88, age: 14});
    console.log("captain = ", captain);
    console.log("captain2 = ", captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log("captain3 = ", captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // assign() method only copies 1 level deep; 2+ levels references original object
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes, {name: "Wesley"});
    console.log("dev = ", dev);

    // resulting object is a multi-level copy of the original object
    // which was originaly stringified, and that string was used to
    // create the new object
